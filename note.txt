major problems occurred in this project:
- let Finansis recognizes English words: solved by using react-speech-recognition npm package which uses Web Speech API.
- let Finansis speaks out loud: solved by copying react-speech-kit npm package's  'useSpeechSynthesis' function and then adding more logic to the function. useSpeechSynthesis function uses Web Speech API too.
- run scraping news script for 24 hours: solved by using python's webbot and Beautiful Soup packages to write scraping news scripts and Replit online IDE to run the scrips for 24 hours and also using python's request package to call news API's 'save articles' endpoint
- let Finansis recognizes unknown commands: solved by creating some logic to check for the user's command against existing commands, you can find the logic in the source code appUtils file under 'code for handling unknown commands' comment.        
- deploy new's api: solved by using vercel
- open yahoo finance website with different stocks (with dynamic value): solved by finding a pattern in yahoo finance' URL which is passing the stock symbol in ${dynamic value} https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/${dynamic value}?p=${dynamic value}
- get real-time stock prices: solved by finding free API to provide real-time stock prices (API URL: https://yahoo-finance-api.vercel.app/${symbol}), (youtube URL of the Creator: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVZXz6awRj4&t=3573s)  
- let Finansis calls puppeteer scripts (automation scrips): solved by creating auto API using node js express which is each endpoint will call specific automation script, and then using Axios to let Finansis calls the API. note: I tried to call puppeteer scripts in react which is Client-side rendering but didn't work because puppeteer scripts only run in Server-side rendering.
part 2
- let Finansis control the popup window that Finansis opened: solved by using puppeteer automation functionality and then doing the same as the above problem's solution. 
- let Finansis calls python scripts (Algorithmic Trading scripts): solved by creating API using python Flask each endpoint will call specific python script, and then using Axios to let Finansis calls Flask API.
- let the user enter info field by field and finansis keep interacting with the user: solved by creating 'InputModal' modal which will open when the time to enter information after a user finishes inputting then entering 'Enter' and then close the modal and save entered data in redux, lastly let finansis response when a data in redux changes. 
- send emails to users: solved by creating endpoint in auto API which will call puppeteer automation script to send emails to a user. note: I tried to use nodemailer but it didn't work without a VPN
- create backTesting interface: solved by cloning Investopedia simulator home page and then customizing it. 
- create backTesting functionality: solved by creating python Flask buy, sell, get sp500 Data, update stocks price and check is market open or not endpoints and then using them in React  
- manage state in big application: solved by using redux which is react state management 
- get the real stocks in the s&p 500 for a specific year in backTesting functionality: this problem is has been not solved yet.
- let finansis learn about stock market questions: solved by searching for an answer in DuckduckGo search engine using puppeteer to type the question, select the first website, scrap the answer and then save the answer in the database. actually, if the question was 'what is market capitalization' finansis will search about the question and add 'investopedia' word at the end of the question for example 'what is market capitalization investopedia' so then the first result will be from investopedia website and that because investopedia is a good website for finding stock market answers
part 3
- let Finansis learn about stocks symbol and their company name: solved by searching for stock in yahoo finance database using puppeteer to type the stock in yahoo finance search bar, select all suggested stocks, scrap the stocks and then save them in the database.
- let Finansis remember an unknown keyword in yahoo finance database for stocks: solved by creating 'unknownKeywordForCompany' model, if Finansis search for a keyword in yahoo finance search bar, but didn't find any stock with the given keyword so then finansis will save the given keyword in the database, for example searching 'Nur' keyword will return nothing, so next time when searching for 'Nur' keyword it will take short time for Finansis to tell a user 'didn't find a stock with the given keyword', let Finansis remember that 'Nur' keyword returns nothing so no need for searching 'Nur' again. 
- not having duplicate news article in the database: solved by making the article's title plus published date plus source a unique value for each article, so when the article has been scrapped, first the script will make get request to the news API by passing the unique value if the article exists then no need to save it again, otherwise send a post request to news API to save the article. 
- not let Finansis recognize her own voice: solved by stopping Finansis from recognizing when Finansis start to speak out loud then after finishing speaking making Finansis start recognize again. in simple words toggle voice recognition.  
- use python to build a stock market bot: solved by searching different Algorithmic stocks trading python scripts, studying them, combining them, and then customizing them by changing conditions and input numbers.

thesis notes:
ABSTRACT:
This project aims to develop a voice-controlled application 
for finance, a voice assistant for finance. this application is the same as Siri, 
Siri is a virtual assistant that is part of Apple Inc.'s iOS but finansis
is more focused on finance more specific the stock market.
Finansis develop for traders or normal people that interested in the stock market.
The system is a web application that can be accessed through the internet.
This system can be used for knowing the stock market news (real-time news), 
knowing current a stock price (real-time price), knowing stock information, showing a stock chart,
asking questions related to the stock market, the ability for finansis to 'learn' about the stock market,
backtesting a trading strategy,and the most interesting is using Algorithmic Trading to trade stocks.

Keywords:
Finance Stock Market Algorithmic Trading python MERN STACK NO-SQL Mongo database scraping automation

into:
The main problem that Finansis application tries to solve is to help
people to have financial freedom, to create a passive income for
them and lastly to make the developer of this application extremely rich.
there are seven main modules in this voice-controlled application User management, Stock Market News, 
Stock information, controlling the app with a voice, letting Finansis response
,back-testing stock trading strategy, and automating stock trading. 
there are 59 commands that Finansis understand plus stock related questions 
(for example 'what is market capitalization) and Finansis can 
ask more than 14 yes/no questions and then respond and do something 
based on a user's answer and lastly, Finansis can ask a user to choose
stock from a list of stocks. Finansis has the ability to 'learn' about related 
Stock market questions and Stocks' symbol, actually Finansis just search in DuckduckGo (search engine like google)
and then save the piece of information in the database. two mini-projects help Finansis
news API, and Trading API, Trading API is a private project, news API is an API to save Scraped news in the database and let finansis retrieve news
from the database and news API is online (api url: https://news-api-lovat.vercel.app/api/v1/news). 
there are four python scraping scripts running for 24 hours online (url:  https://replit.com/@mHmdnwr/Chromium-Advanced-5ad#main.py), 
scraping news from yahoo finance, google finance, investing and seeking websites, and all that for free.

Future Goals For The System 
- Improving UI design.
- Trading stocks with real money.
- Making the System online.
- Creating our own voice Recognition AI.
- Adding Smart contracts 
SYSTEM PROBLEMS AND REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
2.1Functional requirement:
- User management
- Stock Market News
- Stock information
- controlling the app with a voice
- making Finansis response
- asking questions about the stock market
- back-testing stock trading strategy
- automating stock trading (Trading Bot)

The User management module contains all functionality related to users.
a user can register to the app, can log in, can update his/her 
information, can update his/her password, can add and remove stocks 
from his/her watch list, and if a user forgets his/her password a user 
can create a new password by receiving a reset token in his/her email.
 the main function responsible for this module is useUserCommandsHandler in the source code

The Stock Market News module contains all functionality related to the news.
getting news by source, keyword in the headline, latest or top stories.
Get more news. scraping news from yahoo finance, google finance, investing,
and seeking websites. saving scraped news in the database. letting Finansis start 
reading news headlines from the first article, 
start reading them from specific article's number, or stop reading them.
opening article's details page with help of Finansis or without, if a window
opened with Finansis’s help, Finansis can scroll the window. 
the main function is useNewsCommandsHandler.

Stock information module contains all functionality related to stock 
information. opening stock chart using yahoo finance's charts 
with Finansis's help or without, if the chart is opened with 
Finansis's help, Finansis can change the chart's typed daily,
1 minute, or whatever valid type, and Finansis can also zoom the 
chart in or out. opening multiple charts at once only without 
Finansis's help. Get the stock's current price (real-time price) 
for free using the following API (URL: https://yahoo-finance-api.vercel.app/AAPL).
helping finansis to learn about companies. showing users the most
active, gainers, or losers stocks by opening yahoo finance stocks screener. 
showing users a stock statistics by opening yahoo finance stock statistics section.
showing users sold stocks by opening yahoo finance stock chart and then changing the date range to equal 
date of buying and selling of the sold stock.
the main function is useInfoCommandsHandler.

controlling the app with a voice module is to control the app by telling Finansis commands.
navigating between pages by telling finansis 'go forward', 'go back' or 'go to {news|info|...} page' 
({news|info|..} is dynamic values,example: 'go to news page'). 
zooming in or out charts, scrolling news page, scrolling details news page.
closing any popup windows. 

making Finansis response module is to make Finansis speak out loud.
responding to users, asking users yes/no questions, or asking users to choose a stock from a stocks list.
stopping finansis from recognizing when Finansis start speaking out loud

back-testing stock trading strategy module is to let users test stock trading strategy.
users will input start date, end date, initial cash, and account risk per trade.
helping developers of this app to come up with better trading strategy
I will talk about back-testing later in this thesis


asking questions about the stock market module is to let users ask questions about 
the stock market and then Finansis answers the question if the answer of the question
not exist in the database, then Finansis will search in the DuckduckGo (search engine like Google)
and after that save the answer in the database and lastly answer the question so if someone asked the same question
again Finansis just answer it.  

automating stock trading (Trading Bot) module is to let Finansis buy, sell and set stop loss for stocks
using Algorithmic Trading. the trading flow first set stop loss for bought stocks (I will talk about stop loss in the Algorithmic Trading section),
second find sell signals for bought stocks and then sell them if a signal has been found, 
third scrap S&P 500 stocks (I will also talk about S&P 500 stocks in this thesis), and then save them in python array, 
fourth loop through all S&P 500 stocks to find buy signals then save them in the database if a signal has been found,
lastly, get found buy signal stocks from the database and then buy them. 
in this project for current version 1.0 all buy and sell stocks in a simulator for the stock market
I used Investopedia's simulator (URL: https://www.investopedia.com/simulator).

the trading flow first find buy signals then save them in the database,
second, get found buy signal stocks from the database and then buy them
